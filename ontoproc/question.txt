SQL: Requires a predefined schema. Integrating data from multiple sources often involves manual schema mapping, complex joins, and ETL processes.
Ontology: Abstracts different schemas into a unified conceptual model, reducing the need for manual integration steps.

SQL: Operates primarily on the syntactic structure of the data. It doesn't inherently understand the semantics or meanings behind the data.
Ontology: Encapsulates semantic relationships, enabling queries that understand and leverage the meanings and interconnections of concepts.

SQL: Best suited for structured, relational data. Incorporating semi-structured or unstructured data (like JSON, XML) is more cumbersome.
Ontology: Naturally accommodates diverse data formats by mapping them to a common ontology, facilitating easier scalability.

SQL: While capable of complex queries within a relational schema, it struggles with queries that require understanding of relationships beyond explicit joins.
Ontology (SPARQL): Excels at handling complex relationships and can perform inferencing, enabling more intelligent and context-aware queries.
