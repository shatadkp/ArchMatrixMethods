1. Understand Stardog's Reasoning Capabilities

Before implementing custom rules, it's essential to understand the reasoning features Stardog offers:

    Built-in Reasoning: Stardog supports RDFS, OWL 2 RL, EL, QL, and DL profiles.
    Custom Rules: You can define custom inference rules using Stardog's rule syntax.
    Rule Formats: Stardog supports rules written in its proprietary rule language and in SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language).
