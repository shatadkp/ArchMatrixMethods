Unifying Knowledge in Aerospace: The Power of Ontology and Object Properties

In today's aerospace industry, the amount of data generated across engineering, manufacturing, post-sales support, and other operations is staggering. While this data contains valuable insights, its sheer volume and the siloed nature of different teams make extracting actionable knowledge difficult. This is where the power of ontology comes into play—specifically, how using standardized object properties can revolutionize the way we manage information through a digital thread.
What is an Ontology?

Ontology, in computer science, isn't about philosophy; it refers to a formal representation of knowledge. It includes definitions of concepts (classes) and their relationships (object properties), allowing us to model a specific domain in a structured way. In our organization, we use a layered ontology approach:

    Basic Formal Ontology (BFO): Our foundational layer provides the core terms, such as "Process" and "Material Entity."
    Mid-level Ontologies: These connect general terms to more specific domains, such as manufacturing or quality assurance.
    Domain-Specific Ontologies: These extend our mid-level ontology to cover specific fields, like avionics or maintenance.

We employ a hub-and-spoke model to connect these ontologies, where the hub serves as a unifying core, and the spokes extend into domain-specific details.
Why Are Object Properties (Relations) Important?

In ontology, object properties represent relationships between entities. They enable us to connect concepts logically and consistently. For example, the relation "has_part" can be used to describe the relationship between an aircraft and its components. By standardizing these relationships across the organization, we can achieve several key benefits:

    Enabling Complex Queries Across Data Sources
    Standardized relations allow us to query data in ways that are otherwise impossible. Imagine a scenario where an engineer wants to find all aircraft components that were used in the last five maintenance cycles and were involved in specific performance issues. With a standardized ontology, such queries become straightforward, enabling rapid identification of recurring problems and informed decision-making.

    Participating in Formal Logic (First-Order Logic)
    Formal logic is a powerful tool for reasoning over data. In first-order logic, statements about objects and their relationships can be combined to infer new knowledge. For instance, if we know that "Component A is_part_of Aircraft B" and "Aircraft B was_serviced_at Location C," then we can infer that "Component A was_serviced_at Location C." This automated reasoning capability helps us derive insights that are not explicitly recorded in the data.

    Reducing Data Duplication and Inconsistency
    When different teams use different terms to describe the same relationship, it leads to data duplication and inconsistencies. By establishing a common vocabulary, object properties ensure that all teams speak the same language. For example, whether the avionics team refers to a relationship as "contains_part" and the maintenance team calls it "includes_component," using a common term like "has_part" standardizes the relationship across domains.

Real-World Example: Improving Maintenance Operations

Consider our maintenance team, which handles inspections and repairs for aircraft components. Currently, the team logs maintenance activities in one system, while engineering logs component changes in another. When a failure occurs, correlating maintenance history with component changes is time-consuming and error-prone.

By adopting an ontology-based approach, we can unify these data sources. Using the relation "has_output," we can connect the process of "Inspection" to the "Inspection Report" it generates. The relation "affects" could then link the report to the component that was inspected. This integration makes it easier to analyze data across systems, allowing maintenance engineers to quickly identify trends and potential issues.
Why Should We Standardize These Properties?

Standardization of object properties brings several advantages:

    Consistency Across the Organization: When everyone uses the same terminology, communication improves. For instance, a relation like "participates_in" can be used consistently to link agents (such as technicians) to processes (such as inspections) across different teams.
    Enhanced Data Integration: With standardized relationships, we can easily integrate data from different systems, allowing for more holistic analysis. This can help in understanding the full lifecycle of an aircraft, from initial manufacturing to end-of-life disposal.
    Supporting Advanced Analytics: Formal logic provides the foundation for advanced analytics and AI. For example, if we have standardized relations like "precedes" to indicate temporal order, we can use machine learning models to predict future maintenance needs based on historical data.

Technical Insight: How Object Properties Work in Formal Logic

Object properties play a key role in formal logic, specifically first-order logic. Let’s delve into some specifics:

    Domain and Range: Each object property has a "domain" and a "range," which specify the types of entities the property connects. For instance, in the relation "is_part_of," the domain could be "Component," and the range could be "System." This ensures that we only connect entities in meaningful ways.
    Inverse Properties: Many relationships are naturally bidirectional. For example, if "Component A is_part_of System B," then "System B has_part Component A." Ontologies allow us to define such inverse properties, making it easier to traverse relationships in both directions.
    Transitivity: Some properties are transitive, meaning if "A precedes B" and "B precedes C," then "A precedes C." This helps in reasoning about sequences of events, such as maintenance schedules.

Making Ontology Work for You

The use of ontologies and standardized object properties can drastically improve our ability to manage data and extract insights. By embracing this approach, we can solve problems more efficiently, reduce errors, and enable advanced analytics across the organization. We invite teams from engineering, post-sales support, and other domains to collaborate with us, explore their specific needs, and see how a unified ontology can make a significant impact.
